# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 15/08/2025  
**Last Updated:** 15/08/2025

## Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Animind handles your information.

## 1. Data Collection

Animind does not require users to create an account or sign up. The app only allows sign-in with iCloud for the purpose of syncing and storing pet data. We do not collect or store any personal information or pet data on our servers. Your data is stored locally on your device.

## 2. Data Processing and Video Handling

When you request a pet behavior analysis, your video is securely uploaded to our server, which then requests analysis from the Gemini API. After the analysis is complete, our system automatically deletes your video from the server. We do not retain or store any video data after processing is finished.

## 3. iCloud Sync

If you choose to sign in with iCloud, your pet data will be securely synced with your iCloud account. This data remains accessible only to you and is managed by Apple's iCloud services.

## 4. Data Security

All videos and data you upload are transmitted securely and are used solely for the purpose of analysis. After processing, your videos are automatically deleted from our servers and are not retained. We do not store any video or personal data after analysis is complete. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data during transmission and storage, but please be aware that no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.

## 5. Subscription and Billing

If you purchase a PetInterpret AI Pro subscription, your payment and subscription management are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, process, or store any payment or billing information. Apple's Privacy Policy governs how your payment information is handled.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Animind uses the following third-party services: (1) Apple iCloud for data synchronization (if you choose to sign in), (2) Google Gemini API for AI-powered pet behavior analysis, and (3) Apple App Store for subscription management. We do not share your personal data with these services beyond what is necessary for their specific functions.

## 7. Subscription and Billing Information

### 7.1 Payment Processing
All subscription payments for Animind Pro are processed exclusively through Apple's App Store. We do not collect, process, or store any payment information including credit card details, billing addresses, or payment methods. Apple handles all payment processing according to their privacy policy.

### 7.2 Subscription Data
We only receive minimal subscription status information from Apple, such as whether your subscription is active or inactive. This information is used solely to provide appropriate app functionality and features based on your subscription level.

### 7.3 Billing History
Your billing history, receipts, and payment details are maintained by Apple and accessible through your Apple ID account. We do not have access to your detailed billing information or payment history.

### 7.4 Subscription Management
All subscription management activities including upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and refund requests must be handled through your Apple ID settings or by contacting Apple Support directly. We cannot make changes to your subscription or billing status.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time; the latest version is always available [here](https://github.com/pvlata75/Animind/blob/main/PrivacyPolicy.md). Any changes will be posted within the app.
