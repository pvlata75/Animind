## Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Animind handles your information.

## 1. Data Collection

Animind does not require users to create an account or sign up. The app only allows sign-in with iCloud for the purpose of syncing and storing pet data. We do not collect or store any personal information or pet data on our servers. Your data is stored locally on your device.

## 2. Data Processing and Video Handling

When you request a pet behavior analysis, your video is securely uploaded to our server, which then requests analysis from the Gemini API. After the analysis is complete, our system automatically deletes your video from the server. We do not retain or store any video data after processing is finished.

## 3. iCloud Sync

If you choose to sign in with iCloud, your pet data will be securely synced with your iCloud account. This data remains accessible only to you and is managed by Apple's iCloud services.

## 4. Data Security

All videos and data you upload are transmitted securely and are used solely for the purpose of analysis. After processing, your videos are automatically deleted from our servers and are not retained. We do not store any video or personal data after analysis is complete. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data during transmission and storage, but please be aware that no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Animind does not share your data with third parties. The app may use third-party services (such as Apple iCloud) solely for data synchronization.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app.
