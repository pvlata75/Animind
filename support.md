## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### **How does the video analysis work?**
Animind uses advanced AI technology to analyze your pet's behavior in videos. The video is securely uploaded to our servers, analyzed by our AI system, and then automatically deleted. We don't store your videos permanently.

### **What types of behaviors can the app analyze?**
The app can analyze various pet behaviors including:
- Play behavior
- Aggression signs
- Anxiety indicators
- Social interactions
- Training responses
- Health-related behaviors

### **Is my data secure?**
Yes! We take your privacy seriously:
- Videos are automatically deleted after analysis
- No personal data is stored on our servers
- Pet data is stored locally on your device

### **Can I use the app for multiple pets?**
Yes! You can create profiles for multiple pets and analyze behavior for each one separately.

### **What if the analysis isn't accurate?**
AI analysis provides insights based on common behavioral patterns, but it's not a substitute for professional veterinary advice. Always consult with a veterinarian for serious behavioral concerns.
